### Introduction

The purpose of this project is to document my journey towards properly learning web design, while learning via the **The Odin Project**.
While, I do have basic knowledge and some past experience in it, I want to now cement my knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript and more.
Starting with basic HTML, this website willl grow as I delve deeper into the field of web technologies, and development.
